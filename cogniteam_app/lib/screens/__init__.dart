// This file can be empty or used to export all screens for easier imports.
// For example:
// export 'login_screen.dart';
// export 'signup_screen.dart';
// export 'home_screen.dart';
// ... and so on for other screen files
//
// This allows you to import multiple screens with a single line:
// import 'package:cogniteam_app/screens/__init__.dart';
//
// However, often it's also common to import screens directly.
// This file mainly helps in organizing if you have a very large number of screens.
// For now, it just marks the directory as containing screen modules.
//
// Placeholder content:
// To be populated as screens are created.
/*
Placeholder for screen files:
- login_screen.dart
- signup_screen.dart
- edit_agent_screen.dart
- create_group_screen.dart
- chat_screen.dart
- home_screen.dart (or a dashboard)
